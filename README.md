Hi! This is a summary of capstone analyses I worked on as a data science student. The main topic covers financial analyses of ~4000 stocks to identify those that outperform based on annual change in price. Models cover ~200 independent variables based on data reported on 10K filings with SEC. Source of data is at https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks20142018?select=2015_Financial_Data.csv I've also included an analysis of image-processing to detect forgeries and modifications of electronic images. As this is a work-in-progress I welcome ideas, observations, etc. Thank you!
